# Linkedin-job-webscraper
This is a job scraper for Linkedin. I have used selenium. It was really fun scraping data from here as it was a tough task, during the process I learned a lot of things.
1. So firstly I scraped data from my personal job recommendations.
2. I scraped the Job Title, Company Name and Location where I have to work.
3. After this I thought of trying to search some type of job, I searched all the jobs for Software Developement.
4. Then I scraped the data from their.
5. I converted all the data in a DataFrame.
6. Do check out and let me know if I am mistaken somewhere or you want to understand something!
